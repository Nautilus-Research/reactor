# reactor
Reactor is the next-generation development framework as a service initially implemented in pure C# for the Azure cloud. We enable ANY startup to build a hyper-scalable product with a fraction of the time and effort. We do this by handling complexity under the hood and simplifying your code to be more natural and intuitive than was ever possible. 

#1 With our FaaS, you start with a relational database for important, slow-changing data where you need referential integrity & consistency; and MongoDB for fast-changing big data.

- Create most of your data access layer with our code generation tools.
- This data access layer integrates caching, data access & search indexing in one layer.
- You can easily add more methods, using the generated code as a template

 #2 Use our code templates to easily host services that can synchronize your SQL server database with no-code/ low-code to Redis cache and Azure search. No extra coding or mapping is necessary.

 #3 Reference the data access layer within your application to enable a grab-and-go approach coding style where everything important is in memory and you can quickly grab what you want and build your front-end

 - No more complex SQL
 - No more database/ SQL tuning
 - Very cost-effective
 - Extremely scalable
 - Super performant

#4 We handle everything for you:

- Configuration
- State
- Logging
- Alerts
- AI & ML driven multi-threading solution to improve performance beyond what is possible with vanilla multi-threading for most workloads.

This is a solid, stable solution that has been undergoing extensive testing for months. This is designed for startups building products, who want to focus on building their product & not worry about Infrastructure code.

Shave months of development effort, be productive on day 1!
