# reactor

*From the guy who sent that first email to Microsoft with a code prototype showing c# generating Javascript code, which eventually became Blazor...*

Reactor is the next-generation development Framework as a Service (FaaS) initially implemented in pure C# for the Azure cloud. We enable ANY startup to build a hyper-scalable product with a fraction of the time and effort. We do this by handling complexity under the hood and simplifying your code to be more natural and intuitive than was ever possible with conventional methods. 

Visit our website at nautilus2k dot com to learn more about our product. Here is what we do in a nutshell:

#1 With our FaaS, you start with a relational database for important, slow-changing data where you need referential integrity & consistency; and MongoDB for fast-changing big data.

- Create most of your data access layer with our code generation tools.
- This data access layer integrates caching, data access & search indexing in one layer.
- You can easily add more methods, using the generated code as a template

 #2 Use our code templates to easily host services that can synchronize your SQL server database with no-code/ low-code to Redis cache and Azure search. No extra coding or mapping is necessary.

 #3 Reference the data access layer within your application to enable a grab-and-go approach coding style where everything important is in memory and you can quickly grab what you want and build your front-end

 - No more complex SQL
 - No more database/ SQL tuning
 - Very cost-effective
 - Extremely scalable
 - Super performant

#4 We handle everything for you (databases are automatically generated for you at startup):

- Configuration (easily define configuration & initial values in code)
- State
- Logging (from on-premises to cloud, a better implementation than you have ever seen before)
- Alerts (track the health of ALL your services from day 1)
- AI & ML driven multi-threading solution to improve performance beyond what is possible with vanilla multi-threading for most workloads.

#5 A solution designed to stay relevant with massive customer growth:

- Multi-environment support baked in (DEV, QA, PROD)
- Multi-region support baked in (US, AU, EU)
- Multi-tenant support baked in (SQL Elastic Pool)

#6 A solution which allows you to run production apps on the smallest, cheapest cloud VMs with the lowest vCPUs, memory, Disk I/O, and highest network latencies. Save money until you start getting traction, and then scale up seamlessly without burning copious amounts of cash. 

#7 Pure c# code. No tricks, no funky hard-to-understand code. Easy to understand, implement and maintain. 

This is a solid, stable solution that has been undergoing extensive testing for months. This is designed for startups building products, who want to focus on building their product & not worry about Infrastructure code.

Shave months of development effort, and be productive on day 1!
We want to be accessible to ALL. Licensing terms are very flexible and realistic to handle everything from one-person teams to large enterprises and everything in between.
