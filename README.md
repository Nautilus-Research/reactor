# reactor
Reactor is the next-generation development framework as a service initially implemented in pure C# for the Azure cloud. We enable ANY startup to build a hyper-scalable product with a fraction of the time and effort. We do this by handling complexity under the hood and simplifying your code to be more natural and intuitive than was ever possible.
